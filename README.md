## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

Launch Expo with the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

When the Expo CLI starts, you can choose to open the app in:
- a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- an [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- an [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for a quick test run

### 3. Begin Development

The main application code is located in the **Orange2/app** directory. Edit the files inside this directory to start customizing Orange⁺. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for an intuitive navigation setup.

## Resetting the Project

If you need a fresh start, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command relocates the starter code to the **app-example** directory and creates a new, empty **Orange2/app** directory for you to begin development from scratch.
